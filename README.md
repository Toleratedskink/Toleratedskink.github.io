## Adding Project Images

To add images for your projects, place them in the `projects/` directory:

- `projects/netfoundry.jpg` - NetFoundry project screenshot
- `projects/smart-home.jpg` - Smart Home Device project screenshot
- `projects/model-airplane.jpg` - Model Airplane project screenshot

The website will automatically display images if they exist, or show a placeholder if they don't.
